# Plagiarism Checker using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Plagiarism Checker** powered by **Machine Learning**, designed to detect similarities between textual documents. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and ML models to analyze and compare documents for potential plagiarism. The tool is useful for **students, educators, researchers, and content creators** to ensure originality and integrity in written work.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Text Similarity Detection** using NLP techniques.
- 📖 **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stop-word Removal.
- 🎯 **Machine Learning Models**: Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF, and LSTM-based Deep Learning approaches.
- 📊 **Visualization** of similarity scores.
- 📂 **Supports Multiple File Formats** (TXT, PDF, DOCX).
- 🌐 **Web-based Interface** for easy usability.
- 🏎 **Fast and Efficient** comparison even for large datasets.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLTK, Spacy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Text Embeddings**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec
- **Web Framework**: Flask/Django (for UI)
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL (for storing document records)

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Upload Documents**: Users upload text files or paste content.
2. **Preprocessing**: The text is cleaned and tokenized.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings.
4. **Similarity Calculation**: Machine learning models compute similarity scores.
5. **Report Generation**: The system highlights matching sections and provides a similarity percentage.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- **Cosine Similarity** (Traditional Approach)
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- **Deep Learning (LSTM-based model)**
- **BERT Embeddings for Semantic Similarity**
